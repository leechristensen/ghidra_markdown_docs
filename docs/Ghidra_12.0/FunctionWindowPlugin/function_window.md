# Function Window


The Functions window provides a list of functions defined in the currently open program.
To display the Function Window, select the **Window** → **Functions**option on the tool menu.

This window has three columns.  The ***Name*** column shows the
function name.  The ***Address*** column shows the function's address.  The ***Function Signature*** column shows a preview of the
function's signature.  Click on the top of a column to sort the list by that column.  By default, the data is sorted by address ascending.


Click on a function to navigate to that function in the Code Browser.


### Make Selection


The Functions window has an icon (![Make Selection](../icons/stack.png))
on the tool bar to make a selection in the Code Browser. To make a selection,


1. Select the functions in the **Functions** window.
2. Right mouse click and select the ![Make Selection](../icons/stack.png) **Make
Selection** option, OR select the ![Make Selection](../icons/stack.png)button on
the tool bar.


### Compare Selected Functions


The Functions window has an icon (![page_white_c.png](../icons/page_white_c.png) which contains a star
![bullet_star.png](../icons/bullet_star.png)) on the tool bar that allows users to compare
the functions currently selected in the table.


> **Note:** Note that selecting this
will always create a new comparison. If you have an existing comparison
and wish to add functions to it, you must initiate that directly from the
existing comparison window itself.


To create a new comparison:


1. Select the functions you want to compare from the table in the Functions window.
You must select one or more rows in the table.
2. Right mouse click and select the **Compare Selected Functions** option,
OR click the create-comparison icon on the tool bar.


The resulting [Function Comparison](../FunctionComparison/FunctionComparison.md)
window will allow the functions to be viewed side by side.
