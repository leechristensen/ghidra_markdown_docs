# Save Project


Saving a Ghidra Project will commit all of the project-related changes that were made since
the project was opened or since the project was last saved. Saving a project retains
information about:


- The plugins that are being used by the Ghidra Project Window
- The plugins that are being used by each of the running tools
- Options associated with the plugins and/or the tool
- The running tools' sizes and positions on the screen
- Viewed projects
- List of recently opened projects
- The active [workspace](Ghidra_Front_end.md#workspace)


To save the active Ghidra project:


- From the Ghidra Project Window menu, select **File → Save Project**.


> **Tip:** You can also save your project as you exit Ghidra.
