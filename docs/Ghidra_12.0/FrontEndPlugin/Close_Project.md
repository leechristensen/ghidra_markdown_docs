# Close Project


Closing a project will return Ghidra to the NO ACTIVE PROJECT state.   If you have
changed the state of your project (e.g., launched another tool, changed your program, etc.),
Ghidra will prompt you to save your project and any changes you have made to your
program.


To close a project:


1. Select **File → Close Project** from the
menu.
2. If there are unsaved changes, Ghidra will display the  *Save Modified Files*
dialog to allow you to save any changes. Changed items are selected by default. Deselect
items that you do not want saved. Select the **OK** button close the project.

The **Deselect All** button deselects all changed items in your project. If you choose
**OK**, your current project state is not saved and any changes made to your program are
lost.


When the project is closed, the Ghidra Project Window indicates NO ACTIVE PROJECT.
