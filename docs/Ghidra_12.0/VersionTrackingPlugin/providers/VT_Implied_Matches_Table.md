# Version Tracking Implied Matches Table


The implied matches table displays of list of [Implied
Matches](#version-tracking-implied-match) for the selected match in the [Matches
Table](VT_Matches_Table.md#version-tracking-matches-table). The implied matches are generated by pairing up the **outgoing** references
from the two functions in the selected match. Both **function references (calls)** and
**data references** can generate implied matches. If there is already a match in the
session that has the same [association](../Version_Tracking_Intro.md#version-tracking-associations)
as the implied match, then an implied match is not created. Instead, it is indicated by
incrementing the vote count for the current match. If no other match exists, and implied
match is created it is listed as a "Possible Implied Match". For those implied matches that
don't already have a corresponding existing match, the user can created new matches.

In the example shown above, the matches table has a match selected for a function named
"_mainCRTSartup". The Implied Matches table shows a list of implied matches wherever
references from "_mainCRTStartup" in the source program match a similar reference in the
"_mainCRTStartup" function in the destination program. The idea is that if the selected
match in the matches table is **Accepted**, then these other matches may also be
"correct".


## Version Tracking Implied Match


An implied match is simply a function or data match that is implied because of the
correlation of references made by some other match.


## Implied Match Table Columns


| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Source Reference Address | Displays the address in the source program where the implied match is             referenced. |
| Destination Reference Address | Displays the address in the destination program where the implied match is             referenced. |
| Status | Displays the status of the association for this implied match. |
| Type | Displays the type of this implied match. Either Function or Data. |
| Score | The score of the best match with the same association as this implied match, or 0             if no matches exist with this association. |
| Confidence | The confidence score of the best match with the same association as this implied             match, or 0 if no matches exist with this association. |
| Multiple Source Labels? | Icon indicating there is more than one label at the match's source  	          address and a number indicating how many labels. The tooltip can be viewed to see  	          the label names. |
| Source Label | Displays the label at the source address of the implied match. |
| Source Address | Displays the source address of the implied match. |
| Multiple Dest Labels? | Icon indicating there is more than one label at the match's destination  	          address and a number indicating how many labels. The tooltip can be viewed to see  	          the label names. |
| Dest Label | Displays the label at the destination address of the implied match. |
| Dest Address | Displays the destination address of the implied match. |
| Algorithm | Displays the algorithm of the best match with the same association as this implied             match, otherwise, "Possible Implied Match" is displayed. |


## Implied Match Table Actions


**Navigate References** ![locationOut.gif](../../icons/locationOut.gif) When this action toggled on, selecting a row in the
implied matches table will cause the [sub-tools](../VT_Tool.md#version-tracking-sub-tools)
to navigate to the **From Address** of the references used to create the selected
implied match.


**Navigate Match** ![locationIn.gif](../../icons/locationIn.gif) When this action toggled on, selecting a row in the
implied matches table will cause the [sub-tools](../VT_Tool.md#version-tracking-sub-tools)
to navigate to the source and destination addresses of the selected implied match.


The **Accept Implied Match** ![flag.png](../../icons/flag.png) action creates a match in the Matches Table if one
does not already exist, and then sets its status as 'Accepted'. Note, the Implied Matches
shown in the table are not saved unless this action is applied.


## Text Filter


The text filter allows filtering on any text displayed in the table.
