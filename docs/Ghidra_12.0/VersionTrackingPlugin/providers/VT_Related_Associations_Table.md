# Version Tracking Related Matches Table


## Related Matches


The **Related Matches** table is a dockable window that is available in both the
Version Tracking Source Tool and Destination Tool. By default it appears as a small window
in the bottom right corner of the tool. It shows a list of potential matches for the
function or data where the cursor is currently located within the tool's listing. This
match information is generated by the correlators chosen by the user.


The **Related Matches** Table provides fields with the same information as those in
the [Matches
Table](VT_Matches_Table.md). For a description of the table characteristics, see that table. The main
difference between this table and the Matches Table is that this table only displays the
matches related to the current function or data.


### Version Tracking Matches For Source


In the Source Tool the **Related Matches** table shows all correlator or manually
generated matches for the single function or data that is currently active in the Source
Tool. Likewise the **Related Matches** table in the Destination Tool shows all
correlator or manually generated matches for the single function or data that is
currently active in the Destination Tool.


The following image shows an example **Related Matches** table from a Version
Tracking Source Tool.

The information above the table indicates the name and address for the current tool's
function or data. In the Source Tool if the cursor is within a function then the
information above the table shows the current source function's name and entry point
address. *In this case, our cursor is in the function **addPerson** in the Source
Tool.*


The table itself contains a row for each of the matches (if any) for the current function
or data. Each table row shows the name and address of each possible match in the
Destination Tool, along with other match information. *In this case, correlators have
found more than one potential match to the current function in the Source Tool. These
matches might be entirely different functions or the same function but found with
different correlators. In this example, the user decided that "addPerson" in the source
program matched function **addPerson** in the destination program. It has already been
accepted by the user as the correct match. Therefore both rows that indicate a match to
the same destination function are marked accepted. By definition, there can only be one
accepted match per function.*


> **Tip:** Selecting a row in the Related
Match Table causes the Destination Tool to navigate to that selected destination
address.


### Version Tracking Matches For Destination


The Destination Tool has its own **Related Matches** table. This has information
for the function or data where the cursor is currently located in the Destination Tools
listing. Each row of this table indicates a match to a source function. The following
shows the related matches in the Destination Tool that are related to what was selected
above in the Source Tool's table.

*In this case the Destination Tool's cursor is in function **addPerson**. There
are two matches displayed in the table which are to the same source address but were
arrived at by different correlation algorithms.*


> **Tip:** Selecting a row in this table
causes the Source Tool to navigate to that selected source address.


## Actions


### Compare Functions


To initiate this action, navigate to the **Related Matches** table in either the
Destination Tool or the Source Tool. Select one or more matches in the table, then choose
**Compare Functions** from the right-mouse menu. This action will open a new
[Function Comparison](../../FunctionComparison/FunctionComparison.md)
table. The left side of the window will display the function in the current tool location.
The right side of the window will contain a pull-down list with the selected matched
function(s) from the other program. This allows a user to visually compare the function at
the current tool location with the selected matched function(s) from the other program.


Note: You cannot compare Data matches or External Functions using this action, so
if you select either of these as matches they will not be populated in the table.


### Select Match in VT Matches Table


As you select various matches in either **Related Matches** table, the other
(source or destination) tool will navigate to the function or data associated with the
match. However, the selected match in the **Version Tracking Matches** table will
remain the same. To force the selection in the **Version Tracking Matches** table to
match selection in the **Related Matches** table, use this action. This action can be
initiated as follows:


Select a match in the **Related Matches** table and do either of the
following.


- Click the toolbar button, ![Make Selection](../../icons/stack.png).
- Right-click on a row in the **Related Matches** table to get a popup menu.
From the popup menu choose **Select Match in VT Matches Table**.


Either of these will cause the same match to be selected in the Version Tracking
Matches table. When the match becomes selected in the Matches table, the Markup Items
table will update to show the items for that match and the markup items will be marked
with colors in the listings.
