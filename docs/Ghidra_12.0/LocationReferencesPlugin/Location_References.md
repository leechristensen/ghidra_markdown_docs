# Location References Dialog


| ![](images/ReferencesToDialog.png) |
| --- |


The *Location References Dialog* displays all the memory reference destinations to a
specific code unit that is described by the item under the current location. For example, if
the current location is a referenced label, then the dialog will show references to that
label and not the current address. In the following snippet, the label "LAB_40768a" is the
field at the current location.


![](images/LabelReferencesSample.png)


Showing the *Location References Dialog* dialog at this location will show all
references to the label "LAB_4078d2".


This dialog also works with data types. If the item at the current location is a data
type, then all places that data type is applied will be shown and the data type will be
highlighted in the *Data Type Manager* tree.


As another example, if the location is an XRef field location, then the dialog will show
references to the address that the XRef field represents. In the following snippet, the Xref
field "0040767d(j)" is the field at the current location.


![](images/XRefLabelReferencesSample.png)


Showing the *Location References Dialog* dialog at this location will show all
references to the address 0040767d.


> **Tip:** You can also show
references to data types from the Data Type Manager. In this case, all locations where
the selected data type is applied will be highlighted.


## To Find Location References


1. Right-mouse anywhere on the code unit*
2. Select whichever of the following is available from the popup menu:
- Select **References  →  Show References to**
from the popup menu.
- Select **References  →  Find References to**
from the popup menu.
- Select **References  →  Find Uses of**
from the popup menu.


*If the Location References Dialog cannot show
references to the location that
was clicked, then the menu item will be disabled.


The results of performing this action depend upon the location the cursor when the
popup is shown.  Here are some examples:


- When over a data type, a **search** is performed for all uses of that data type, such
as in function signatures and locations that type is applied in memory,
- When over an address, all references to the code unit containing that address will
be shown, (which is what the
[Show References to Address](#to-show-location-references-to-code-unit) action does),


### Results Window Header


This title displays the item that is the destination of all the references
in the *Reference(s)* table.


The ![go-home.png](../icons/go-home.png) button will
cause the code browser to return the cursor to the location from which the dialog was
launched.


The ![Refresh](../icons/reload3.png) button will
refresh the table of references. This button will appear disabled when the data is not
stale. However, if Ghidra detects that the data *may* be stale, then the button will
become color filled, as it is here. You may push the button for a refresh in either
state.


The ![Make Selection](../icons/stack.png) button
will create a selection in the code browser with the reference entries selected in the
table. You may also access this feature by right-clicking an item in the table and
selecting **Make Selection**.


> **Tip:** To instead make a Program Selection Highlight, use the select button mentioned above.
Then, click from the menu bar Select Program Highlight Entire Selection


The ![tag_yellow.png](../icons/tag_yellow.png)
button toggles the highlighting of the matching references.   In this case, the
term highlight refers to the background color of the item in the Listing and not
a [Program Selection
Highlight](../SetHighlightPlugin/Highlighting.md).


The ![Delete](../icons/edit-delete.png)
button deletes the selected reference(s).  This will delete the reference from the database.


![](../shared/note.yellow.png)Not all table rows can be deleted. This is
because the table shows not just items that have a database reference, but also items
that are dynamic references, as well as general uses of an item, such as a data access
generated by the Decompiler.  The delete action will only allow you to delete references
that are in the database.


### Search Results


This table displays a list a reference sources, one for each reference associated with
the selected destination instruction or data item. There are four fields by default that
are displayed in the table:


***Location -*** Shows the source address.


***Label -*** Shows the primary label at the source address (if one exists).


***Preview -*** Shows the instruction or data item at the source address.


***Context -*** Shows the type of reference to the current location.  If the
result is a Ghidra in-memory Reference, then this column will show the type of
reference.  If the result is found by way of the Decompiler, then the line from
the decompiled function will be shown.


> **Tip:** You can make a
selection in the Code Browser from the entries in the table:


1. Click on an entry in the table, or Ctrl-click to select multiple entries.
2. Right mouse click and choose **Make** **Selection**.
- The current selection in the Code Browser is set to include the addresses that
you selected in the Address table.


## To Find Location References to Data Types


From within the [Data Type Manager](../DataTypeManagerPlugin/data_type_manager_description.md)
you can right-click on a data type and select **Find Uses of**. This will show a
*Location References Dialog* that lists all locations where the selected data type is

applied, such as in function signatures, return types, structures, etc. For `FunctionDefinition`s
the action will display all places that function is applied.


> **Tip:** When searching for references to a field of
a composite data type via the popup menu in the Data Type Manager,
you can search by name or by offset within the parent data type.  This is useful when
the field you seek does not have a name.


> **Note:** By default, finding uses of
data types will search not only for applied data types, but also will perform
dynamic discovery of data types using the Data Type Reference Finder service.   This causes the search to be slower, but also reports many more type
uses.  To disable the dynamic searching, use the Search Dynamic Data Type Discovery tool option .


## To Show Location References to Code Unit


1. Right-mouse anywhere on the code unit*
2. Select **References  →  Show References to
Address** from the popup menu.


This will show all references to the current address, as well as all addresses consumed
by the current instruction or data.


*If the Location References Dialog cannot show
references to the location that
was clicked, then the menu item will be disabled.


> **Note:** This action will show only direct
references to the current code unit. No other special reference finding will take place.
