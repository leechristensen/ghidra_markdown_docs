# Searching


Ghidra offers a variety of searching capabilities.  The *Search Program Memory*
feature performs fast searching for byte patterns in program memory.  The *[Search Program Text](Search_Program_Text.md)* feature searches for text strings in
various parts of the listing such as comments, labels, mnemonics, and operands.  The
*[Search and Replace](SearchAndReplace.md)* features allows for globally
searching and replacing names or comments on many different types of program elements such as
Labels, Functions, Datatypes, Enum Values, and many others. The
*[Search For Strings](Search_for_Strings.md)* feature
automatically finds potential ascii strings within the program memory.
