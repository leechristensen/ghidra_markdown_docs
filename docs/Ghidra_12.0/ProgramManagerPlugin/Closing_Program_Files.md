# Closing Programs


Closing a program will remove the program from the Tool. The Tool will remain displayed but
will display either another open program or be empty.


If the program to be closed has changes and is open in only one tool, the user will be
prompted to save the program.  However, if the program is open in multiple tools, the user
will not be prompted to save even if changes have been made. In other words, the only time the
user will be prompted to save a program that is being closed is when it has been changed and is
open only in one tool.


## To Close a Program File


1. From the Tool menu, select **File →
Close**
2. If changes were made to the program and they haven't been saved yet, the *Save
Program?* dialog appears.

The buttons in the *Save Program?* dialog perform the following functions.


- **Save** - Saves the program changes and close the program in the current tool.
- **Don't Save** - Discards any changes that were made to the program and closes
it.
- **Cancel** - Leaves the program open in the current tool without any changes being
saved.
