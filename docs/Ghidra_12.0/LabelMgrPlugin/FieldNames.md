# Field Names


A field name is associated with each field/component of a composite
data-type such as a Structure or Union.  Field names may be
modified via the data-type editor (see [Structure or
Union Data Type Editors](../DataTypeEditors/StructureEditor.md)) or using the Edit Field Name...
popup menu item.  This action is available within the code listing
panel with the mouse pointer on a structure or union field.


## Edit Field Name Dialog


The *Edit Field Name*dialog will be filled in with the
current field name when displayed.
