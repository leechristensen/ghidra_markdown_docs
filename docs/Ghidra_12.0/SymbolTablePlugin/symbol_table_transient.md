# Temporary Symbol Table


The Temporary Symbol Table is a table created by providers that have the **Create Table**
action, such as the [Symbol Tree](../SymbolTreePlugin/SymbolTree.md) or
the [Symbol Table](symbol_table.md).  It contains the
same columns as the Symbol Table.


This table functions much like the [Search Results Table](../Search/Query_Results_Dialog.md).  For example, this table supports the ability to remove rows.


## Drag and Drop


This table supports the dragging of symbols into the table.  This allows you to add to
the table as you are using the tool.   The source of a drag can be a provider that knows how
to drag symbols, such as the Symbol Tree, the Symbol Table and other temporary symbol tables.


## Actions


This table supports the general actions of the
[Search Results Window](../Search/Query_Results_Dialog.md).


### Create Table From Selection


This table supports the ability to create a new table with the selected rows.
