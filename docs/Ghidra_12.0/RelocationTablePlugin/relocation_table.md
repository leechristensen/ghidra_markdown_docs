# Relocation Table


The Relocation Table displays a tabular view of each relocation defined in the program.
Relocations are address locations that need to be updated to reflect where the program is loaded
into memory. The relocation information is specific to the original format of the
program and it is generated by
the [Automatic Importer](../ImporterPlugin/importer.md).
